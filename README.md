# Nutrition Helper using AWS S3 Bucket‚Äù üçèüì¶  

---

## Project Overview

Nutrition Helper is a fully static, S3-hosted web application that guides users toward healthier eating by combining **personalized nutrition**, **real-time tracking**, and **community support**. Static files (HTML/CSS/JS/assets) are served via an AWS S3 bucket, while CloudFront and Route 53 ensure fast, secure global access .

---

## Motivation & Background

- **The Challenge:** Many individuals lack easy-to-use, personalized tools to manage their daily nutrition. Traditional apps often require complex setups or expose private data.  
- **Our Solution:** A **privacy-first**, cost-effective web platform that runs entirely on AWS S3‚Äîeliminating server maintenance‚Äîwhile delivering dynamic user experiences through client-side JavaScript and third-party APIs.  
- **Goals:**  
  1. **Empower** users with clear, actionable dietary insights.  
  2. **Simplify** meal logging and nutrient analysis.  
  3. **Foster** a community of health-focused learners.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration & Authentication**  
   - **Secure Sign-Up/Login:** Email/password flows with client-side validation.  
   - **Session Management:** Token-based sessions stored in browser localStorage for persistent, secure access.

2. **Nutrition Tracking**  
   - **Meal Logger:** Select foods from a comprehensive database; specify portion sizes.  
   - **Quick Add:** Barcode scanner or ‚Äúfavorite meals‚Äù for rapid entry.  
   - **Time-Stamped Entries:** Meals are auto-tagged by date/time for historical review.

3. **Nutrient Analysis**  
   - **Calorie & Macro Breakdown:** Instant display of calories, carbs, protein, and fats per entry.  
   - **Micro-nutrients:** Detailed vitamin and mineral counts pulled via external API.  
   - **Daily Totals:** Aggregates user intake against recommended daily values (RDVs).

4. **Meal Planning**  
   - **Custom Plans:** Build daily or weekly meal templates based on calorie/macronutrient targets.  
   - **Drag & Drop UI:** Intuitive interface for reordering meals or swapping ingredients.  
   - **Plan Sharing:** Export/print feature for nutritionist review or in-app sharing with friends.

5. **Recipe Repository**  
   - **Browse & Search:** Filter recipes by cuisine, dietary preference (e.g., vegan), or nutrient profile.  
   - **Nutritional Breakdown:** Each recipe lists total and per-serving macros and micros.  
   - **User-Submitted Recipes:** Community members can upload and annotate their own recipes.

6. **Customized Recommendations**  
   - **AI-Driven Suggestions:** Basic machine-learning model suggests meals or snacks based on past logs, goals, and activity level.  
   - **Adaptive Goals:** Targets adjust dynamically as users log progress or update weight/measurements.

7. **Progress Tracking**  
   - **Interactive Charts:** Visualize weight change, macro compliance, and nutrient gaps over time.  
   - **Milestones & Badges:** Gamified achievements for streaks (e.g., ‚Äú7-day tracking streak‚Äù).

8. **Community Engagement**  
   - **Discussion Forums:** Topic-based threads for recipe ideas, tips, and support.  
   - **Peer Challenges:** Form groups for shared goals (e.g., ‚Äú30-day protein challenge‚Äù).

9. **Mobile Compatibility**  
   - **Responsive Design:** CSS Flexbox and Grid ensure layouts adapt from desktop to smartphone.  
   - **PWA Ready:** Basic service-worker setup allows offline viewing of static assets.

10. **AWS S3 Bucket Integration**  
    - **Static Hosting:** All site files uploaded to S3; no server-side code needed.  
    - **CDN Acceleration:** CloudFront distributes assets globally for <200 ms latency.  
    - **Custom Domain & HTTPS:** Route 53 DNS and S3 bucket policy for secure, branded URLs .

11. **Security & Compliance**  
    - **Encryption:** TLS for data in transit; S3-managed encryption for data at rest.  
    - **Access Controls:** Fine-grained bucket policies restrict unauthorized access.  
    - **Privacy-First:** No personal health data stored on servers‚Äîonly in user‚Äôs browser or optional backend.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

| Layer             | Technology                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Static Website    | AWS S3, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript   |
| CDN & DNS         | AWS CloudFront, AWS Route 53      |
| Local Persistence | IndexedDB or LocalStorage         |
| Dev Tools         | VS Code, Chrome DevTools |

**High-Level Flow:**  
1. User loads `index.html` from S3 ‚Üí  
2. JS initializes auth & syncs with localStorage ‚Üí  
3. Meal entries trigger API calls (Nutritionix) ‚Üí  
4. Nutrient data rendered and stored locally ‚Üí  
5. Charts generated via Chart.js ‚Üí  
6. CloudFront caches and delivers subsequent requests.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   - Using Git
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it manually.
2. **Local Testing**  
   - Open `http://localhost/nutrition-helper/index.html` in browser.
3. **Deploy to AWS S3**  
   - Create public S3 bucket (enable static website hosting).  
   - Upload all files and set correct MIME types (`.html` ‚Üí `text/html`, etc.).  
   - Attach Bucket Policy for public read access.  
   - (Optional) Configure CloudFront & Route 53 for performance & custom domain.
4. **Enjoy!**  
   Navigate to the S3 website endpoint or your custom domain.
